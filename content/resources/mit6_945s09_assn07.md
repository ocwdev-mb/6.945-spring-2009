description: Problem set on the generate and test technique, backtracking mechanisms,
  linguistically implicit search, continuations, continuations as non-local exits,
  continuations for backtracking, continuations and dynamic contexts, dynamic contexts
  and within-continuation, AMB, depth-first and breadth-first, and less deterministic
  non-determinism.

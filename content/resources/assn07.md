description: Supporting files for a problem set on the generate and test technique,
  backtracking mechanisms, linguistically implicit search, continuations, continuations
  as non-local exits, continuations for backtracking, continuations and dynamic contexts,
  dynamic contexts and within-continuation, AMB, depth-first and breadth-first, and
  less deterministic non-determinism.

  "course_description": "This course covers concepts and techniques for the design and implementation of large software systems that can be adapted to uses not anticipated by the designer. Applications include compilers, computer-algebra systems, deductive systems, and some artificial intelligence applications. Topics include combinators, generic operations, pattern matching, pattern-directed invocation, rule systems, backtracking, dependencies, indeterminacy, memoization, constraint propagation, and incremental refinement. Substantial weekly programming assignments are an integral part of the subject.\n\nThere will be extensive programming assignments, using [MIT/GNU Scheme](http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/). Students should have significant programming experience in Scheme, Common Lisp, Haskell, CAML or some other \"functional\" language.\n",
